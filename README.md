# File Sorter ðŸ“š

## Description
File Sorter is a Python script designed to organize files in your user's Downloads folder based on their file types. This tool helps keep your system tidy and makes finding specific files easier.

## Features
- **Automatic Organization:** Sorts files into respective folders (e.g., images, documents, videos).
- **User-Friendly:** Simple installation and usage instructions.
- **No External Dependencies:** Built using Python standard library, making it lightweight and easy to run.

## Installation
To use File Sorter, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gag3301v/File-Sorter.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd File-Sorter
   ```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s how you can use the `file_sorter.py` script:

```python
# Import the main function from file_sorter module
from file_sorter import sort_files

# Call the function to organize files in your Downloads folder
sort_files()
```

The script will print the destination path of each file before moving it, ensuring you know where each file has been sorted.

## Configuration
No additional configuration is required. The script uses Python's built-in `os` and `shutil` modules for file operations.
